UI / Visual Changes

    Theme overhaul: Switched entire page to a felt‑green “card‑table” background and kept it consistent after each refresh.

    Theme overhaul: Introduced gold‑accent variables and gradients for logo, buttons, and banners.

    Branding: Renamed game from Three’s to Top That!.

    Branding: Added centered logo + tagline block; current tagline: One Pile. One Winner. No Mercy.

    Layout & spacing: Player and opponent panels wrapped in matching bordered boxes.

    Layout & spacing: Spacing rules – twice the space between opponent area and deck, half that between deck and main player; applied to desktop & mobile break‑points.

    Layout & spacing: Up‑cards now hover slightly over down‑cards to reveal the hidden layer.

    Layout & spacing: Buttons repositioned so they never overlap cards; consistent margin across viewports.

    Card presentation: Cards sort visually from lowest → highest each render for every player.

    Card presentation: Double‑click to play on the main hand; single‑click toggles selection highlight.

    Card presentation: “COPY” badge overlay appears on 5s that duplicate a value.

    Card presentation: Card hover / selected states styled with subtle lift‑and‑shadow.

    Pile & status indicators: Discard‑pile counter recolored to match theme.

    Pile & status indicators: Error banner when a player cannot play; pile is not taken until the player clicks the banner.

    Pile & status indicators: Share‑link banner made clickable so users can copy/send the room URL.

    Rules & helper text: Rules panel pinned top‑left, directly under the logo block for constant reference.

    Rules & helper text: Reformatted rules with indented dashes, no extra commentary, and clarified special‑card effects.

Game‑Play / Logic Changes

    Special‑card engine: 2 resets the pile (next player can lay any card).

    Special‑card engine: 5 copies last value unless it starts a fresh pile, in which case it’s a normal 5.

    Special‑card engine: 10 clears the pile without granting an extra turn.

    Multi‑card plays: Added index‑tracking so simultaneous plays of doubles/triples register correctly.

    Copied‑flag lifecycle: Flag is set only while a copied card is in play and removed automatically if a player picks up the pile.

    Turn validation: Illegal play now prevented in real time; server returns “Illegal play” and UI leaves cards in hand.

    Pile pick‑up flow: After an invalid play, the error banner appears; clicking it transfers the pile to that player, then flips one deck card to seed the new pile.

    Hand ordering: sortHand() runs on every draw, play, and pile‑pickup for all participants so their hands stay low→high.

    Real‑time feedback: Socket events for join/leave/status broadcast to lobby and in‑game clients.

Dev / Quality‑of‑Life Additions

    Final working snapshot committed with message “Final working game state with sortHand and copied fix” for easy reference.

    Added Ctrl + R debug hook that explicitly calls game.reset() and logs socket IDs on connect.

    Style, client, and index files are treated as “authoritative copies”; every change sent as complete files to avoid partial merges.

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    Duplicate player fix
    
     I reviewed your codebase and found the likely cause of the duplicate computer player display: in public/client.js, when rendering the list of other players in the socket.on('state', ...) handler, the #other-players container is not cleared before new player panels are appended. This causes the UI to accumulate duplicate panels for the computer player (and possibly other players) on each state update.

To fix this, I will update client.js so that #other-players is cleared at the start of each state update before rendering the new list of players.
client.js+3-0

Checked client.js, no problems found

The fix has been applied and there are no errors in client.js. The UI will now correctly clear and re-render the list of other players, preventing duplicate computer player panels from appearing. Your issue should be resolved.

# Remove duplicate or unused files for clarity

## Local Development

To start the server in development mode with automatic restarts on file changes:

```
npm run dev
```

This uses nodemon to watch and restart server.js. The custom restart-server.js script is not needed for local dev.



Add Audio Feedback
• Play card‑flip, deal, burn/reset sound effects and subtle background music to make turns feel more tactile.

Card‑Play Animations
• Animate cards moving from hand to the central pile (CSS transforms or a small JS tween library) for smoother feedback.

Mobile‑First & Responsive Refinements
• Tighten up media‑queries so banners, piles, and buttons reflow cleanly on narrower phones and tablets.

Accessibility & ARIA
• Add proper ARIA roles/labels to cards, buttons, and modals; ensure high‑contrast mode; keyboard‑only play.

Theming & Customization
• Offer light/dark mode or alternate color palettes via CSS variables, letting players choose their look.

Persistent Leaderboard & Stats
• Track wins, streaks, average game length server‑side and display on a “Hall of Fame” or post‑game screen.

In‑Game Chat or Emotes
• Allow quick chat or emoji reactions so human players can taunt or cheer each other.

Refactor & Modularize CSS
• Break the monolithic style.css into components (e.g. cards.css, layout.css) or adopt a utility framework (Tailwind, BEM) for maintainability.

Lazy‑Load & Cache Assets
• Preload only a subset of card images; dynamically fetch more as needed to speed initial load.

Enhanced Error/Notice UI
• Replace the plain error banner with sliding toast notifications or snackbars that stack neatly and time out more gracefully.
